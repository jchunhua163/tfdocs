# Module: tf.contrib.keras.callbacks



Defined in [`tensorflow/contrib/keras/api/keras/callbacks/__init__.py`](https://www.tensorflow.org/code/tensorflow/contrib/keras/api/keras/callbacks/__init__.py).

Keras callback classes.

## Classes

[`class BaseLogger`](../../../tf/contrib/keras/callbacks/BaseLogger.md): Callback that accumulates epoch averages of metrics.

[`class CSVLogger`](../../../tf/contrib/keras/callbacks/CSVLogger.md): Callback that streams epoch results to a csv file.

[`class Callback`](../../../tf/contrib/keras/callbacks/Callback.md): Abstract base class used to build new callbacks.

[`class EarlyStopping`](../../../tf/contrib/keras/callbacks/EarlyStopping.md): Stop training when a monitored quantity has stopped improving.

[`class History`](../../../tf/contrib/keras/callbacks/History.md): Callback that records events into a `History` object.

[`class LambdaCallback`](../../../tf/contrib/keras/callbacks/LambdaCallback.md): Callback for creating simple, custom callbacks on-the-fly.

[`class LearningRateScheduler`](../../../tf/contrib/keras/callbacks/LearningRateScheduler.md): Learning rate scheduler.

[`class ModelCheckpoint`](../../../tf/contrib/keras/callbacks/ModelCheckpoint.md): Save the model after every epoch.

[`class ProgbarLogger`](../../../tf/contrib/keras/callbacks/ProgbarLogger.md): Callback that prints metrics to stdout.

[`class ReduceLROnPlateau`](../../../tf/contrib/keras/callbacks/ReduceLROnPlateau.md): Reduce learning rate when a metric has stopped improving.

[`class RemoteMonitor`](../../../tf/contrib/keras/callbacks/RemoteMonitor.md): Callback used to stream events to a server.

[`class TensorBoard`](../../../tf/contrib/keras/callbacks/TensorBoard.md): Tensorboard basic visualizations.
