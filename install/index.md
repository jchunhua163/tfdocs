  * [Transitioning to TensorFlow 1.0](../install/migration.md)

The following guides explain how to install TensorFlow libraries for use in
other programming languages. These APIs are aimed at deploying TensorFlow
models in applications and are not as extensive as the Python APIs.

  * [Installing TensorFlow for Java](../install/install_java.md)
  * [Installing TensorFlow for C](../install/install_c.md)
  * [Installing TensorFlow for Go](../install/install_go.md)
